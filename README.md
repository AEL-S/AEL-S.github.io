## My Portfolio 

I am currently enrolled in the MIT xPro Full Stack Development with MERN certificate course and will be updating my GitHub with the work I complete throughout the program to showcase my progress as I learn. Right now my portfolio contains three projects: https://ael-s.github.io/PacMen/, https://ael-s.github.io/EyeExercise/, and https://github.com/AEL-S/RealTimeBusTracker - this one does not have a GitHub Pages page since it requires a personal API key . This link will take you to the repo where you can fork and clone the files, and add your own API key to make it run. 

<h2>To Run:</h2>
Everything required to run this portfolio is in this repository, or you can just navigate to: https://ael-s.github.io.

<h2>Roadmap of future improvements:</h2>
I will be returning to update my portfolio with various projects I complete throughout the MIT xPro course until it ends in March of 2023. I will also be taking advantage of the resources I have been given to further my learning and continue growing as a developer.
